# Github:
## 1. What is Github?
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets people work together on projects from anywhere.

## 2. Creating repositories(used to organise a single project)
Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets â€“ anything your project needs. Hello-world repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others. Creating branches(working on various parts/versions of the same repository) Make and commit changes(if one wishes to change any particular part of code or some statements ) Pull request(propsing your changes to someone else to get reviewed) Merge request(merging the branch reviewed by others into the master branch) This is how a particular project can be made organized and working on it becomes simpler and more collaberative.

## 3. Creating branch(work on different versions of a repository at one time)
By default repositoy has a branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master. If someone else made changes to the master branch while we were working on your branch, we could pull in those updates
